## camdats dotfiles

if you want to use these dotfiles it's gonna require quite a bit of work. You'll probably want to begin by reconfiguring the rc.lua which is pretty well commented so it shouldn't be too hard. The hard part begins in the mess that is the theme.lua, first you'll want to point all the icons to their correct locations (yes I know I'm and idiot for chaging the default theme). You can find all the icons/backgrounds neccessary in the icons folder. 


I also included my Xresources and bashrc, I use urxvt but I'm fairly certain you'll only need to make a handful of changes for it to work in various shells.
